* [Slide In Scroll Box Popup](https://optinmonster.com/features/slide-in-forms/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme "Slide In Scroll Box Popup" ): Show a targeted popup offer with this high-converting scroll box that slides from the corner.
* [Mobile Popup](https://optinmonster.com/features/mobile-friendly-popups/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme "Mobile Popup" ): Optimize your popup or fullscreen campaigns with pre-made layouts for smartphone and tablets.

You can customize every last detail of your popup with our easy to use drag and drop popup builder—no coding needed.

We also make it really easy to add any element you want to your popup including video, social icons, images, buttons, and so much more.

= Easy Integration with All Email Marketing Services =

OptinMonster started with the goal to make the most beginner-friendly WordPress popup plugin to grow your email list and increase eCommerce sales. That's why **it just works** out of the box with all popular email marketing services including but not limited to:

Mailchimp, AWeber, Drip, ConvertKit, Infusionsoft, GetResponse, Constant Contact, CampaignMonitor, Hubspot, Marketo, ActiveCampaign, Pardot, TotalSend, Emma, iContact, MailerLite, Customer.io, MailPoet, and FeedBlitz.

You can also use custom HTML forms as well as add shortcodes to your popup to include other form plugins like WPForms, Formidable Forms, and more.

= Powerful Exit-Intent® Technology and Mobile Exit Intent =

OptinMonster is a pioneer of [exit intent popup technology](https://optinmonster.com/features/exit-intent/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme "Exit Intent Popup Technology" ).

Exit-Intent® helps you track your user's mouse behavior and prompts them with a targeted exit popup message at the precise moment they are about to leave.

Our WordPress exit popup allows you to re-engage visitors and encourage them to subscribe to your email list or complete their purchase. And, using an exit popup is proven to increase conversions.

You can also create a mobile exit popup that triggers on scroll up or when the visitor taps the back button.

We used an exit popup on our site, [WPBeginner](http://www.wpbeginner.com/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=omwpreadme "WPBeginner - Beginners Guide to WordPress"), and increased conversions by over 600%.

But the success doesn't stop there. Check out what one of our customers, and a respected industry leader, was able to do with OptinMonster’s exit popup solutions:

> In only 7 months, **we added more than 95,000 names to our email list** using OptinMonster's Exit-Intent® technology. We strongly recommend it!

> Michael Stelzner - Founder of Social Media Examiner

= Advanced Page Level Targeting and Behavior Personalization =

Our WordPress popup plugin integrates with our powerful targeting and segmentation engine so you can show your perfect popup offer to the right people at the exact right time to maximize your lead generation and website conversion.

You can even use OptinMonster to improve your advertising by targeting your OptinMonster popup campaigns to your pay-per-click (PPC) advertising campaigns.

OptinMonster's [page level targeting module](https://optinmonster.com/features/page-level-targeting/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme "Page-Level Targeting") lets you show unique popup offers and campaigns based on visitor's location and interaction on your website.

This means you can segment your email list and group email subscribers based on their interest and interaction with your popup campaign or website, leading to better lead generation, higher open rates, higher click-through rates, increased sales, greater revenue, greater customer retention, lower unsubscribe rates, and better overall marketing results.

Check out the impact this had for one of our users:

> OptinMonster played a critical role in increasing my email opt-in conversion rate by 469%. In real numbers, **that is the difference between $7,765 and $47,748 per month** in revenue.

> Matthew Woodward - Professional Blogger and SEO Expert

= Easy to Use A/B Split Testing =

A/B split testing is one of the most desired features for any marketing platform, but normally it's extremely hard for beginners to get it going.

Well, we changed all that and now _it just works_ as part of the best WordPress popup plugin on the market.

OptinMonster's easy [A/B split testing](https://optinmonster.com/features/easy-ab-split-testing/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme "A/B split testing" ) tool helps you eliminate the guesswork and make data-driven decisions on what works best for your popup and email opt in forms.

You can try different content, headlines, layouts, styles, and optin triggers on your popup to see what makes your offer convert best.

> Using OptinMonster **we got a 300% improvement on our email conversion rates** which translated into significant revenue. We have tried many similar popup plugins and nothing can compete with OptinMonster.

> Ian Cleary - Founder of RazorSocial

= Detailed Conversion Analytics =

OptinMonster's [conversion analytics](https://optinmonster.com/features/conversion-analytics/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme "conversion analytics" ) is easy to understand and give you the stats that matter, so you can take action to improve your popup lead generation strategy.

= MonsterLinks™—2 Step Email Opt In Technology =

[MonsterLinks™](https://optinmonster.com/features/monsterlinks/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme "MonsterLinks™" ) let you easily create a WordPress popup on click, which is proven to boost conversions by as much as 785%. These are a great way to offer content upgrades. Then you can use OptinMonster's success redirect feature for lead magnet delivery.

= Streamlined eCommerce Integration =
